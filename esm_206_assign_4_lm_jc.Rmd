### Introduction


The California Spiny Lobster (*panulirus interruptus*) is an important species in the kelp forests in California. Lobsters are a vital predator of kelp-eating sea urchins. Without predation, sea urchins have the ability to demolish kelp forests and create urchin barrens, destroying the ecological diversity that kelp forests create.

### Data and Methods

Data for this project was collected from 2012-2018 by the Santa Barbara Chanel Long Term Ecological Research team. Lobster numbers and sizes were collected by divers at 5 sites, including two Marine Protected Areas (Naples and Isla Vista) and three (Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk and Carpinteria). All samples were gathered in the late summer before the start of the fishing season.
 

Naples and Isla Vista were designated Marine Protected Areas in January 2012

### Results

##### Results A

group by year, showing changes in annual lobster abundance at the five sites over time

for the two Marine protected areas, comparing the means between 2012 and 2018 (n = `r n_mpa`), the mean is `r round(mean_mpa, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa, 2)` (two-sided t-test, t(`r round(mpa_2012_2018_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(mpa_2012_2018_ttest$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(mpa_2012_2018_ttest$p.value, 4)`)

for the three Non-Marine Protected Areas, comparing the means between 2012 and 2018, the mean is `r round(mean_non_mpa, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_non_mpa, 2)` (two-sited t-test, t(`r round(non_mpa_2012_2018_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(non_mpa_2012_2018_ttest$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(non_mpa_2012_2018_ttest$p.value, 2)`)
